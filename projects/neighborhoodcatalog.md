title: 'Neighborhood Cat-alog'
---

*Neighborhood Cat-alog* is a 22-page risograph zine celebrating the many cats (and other notable creatures) that I’ve encountered in my neighborhood. Printed in fluorescent orange, medium blue, and lime green ink, the zine uses vibrant, punchy color to bring these local animal personalities to life. I handled all writing, illustration, and layout, with a focus on playful observation and bold visual storytelling. The zine debuted at Short Run, Seattle’s annual comic and zine festival, and reflects my love for community-based storytelling and analog print processes.

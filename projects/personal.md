title: 'lauradzeng Stickers'
---

Through my personal brand *lauradzeng*, I create a wide range of original stickers that span from lighthearted and whimsical to introspective and thought-provoking. Whether itâ€™s a chubby cat on a skateboard or a quiet reflection on identity, each design is grounded in bright, colorful visuals and charming animal characters. These projects allow me to explore storytelling through accessible, small-format art while building a distinct voice that resonates with both casual buyers and deeper thinkers. My designs have found success through both direct sales and wholesale, with 26 retailers (and counting!) carrying my work across the US -- a testament to the broad appeal and staying power of my artistic voice.

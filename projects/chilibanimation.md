title: 'Chili B POV Animation'
---

I created a custom intro and outro animation for Chili B POV, an ASMR YouTube channel. Working closely with the channel’s creator, Hannah, I designed animations that visually reflect the magical tone of her content while staying true to her existing brand colors and aesthetic. This project highlights my ability to translate a client’s vision into motion, bringing together brand identity, mood, and storytelling in a cohesive animated package.

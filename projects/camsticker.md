title: 'Common Area Writers Membership Sticker'
---

Commissioned by Common Area Maintenance, a Seattle-based artist collective, I designed a set of four die-cut vinyl waterproof stickers to celebrate the launch of their new writers’ membership. The client wanted artwork that reflected both the collaborative nature of writing and the diversity of voices within CAM. Through close collaboration, we landed on four unique designs that visually captured the collective’s inclusive, creative spirit. This project highlights my ability to interpret abstract themes into tangible, high-quality products that speak to a community’s values.

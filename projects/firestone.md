title: 'Firestone Artist Takeover Mural'
---

I was invited to participate in the Firestone Artist Takeover, an event hosted by Aaron Asis and Brady Black with the support of the City of Seattle and One Seattle Graffiti Team. The project involved inviting a group of beginner muralists to take a portion of the wall of an abandoned building (formerly a Firestone) and make whatever they wanted. 

I chose to create a mural showing my two cats (Mishka and Piroshky) walking in the garden at night. My cats are meant to be indoor only cats, but they are very opinionated and very agile and can sometimes get past me when I come home after a day of work. 

The mural is approximately 8 ft x 10 ft and can be seen at 1140 NW 54th St, Seattle, WA 98107.

# Hi, friends!
Laura Zeng is a Chinese-American artist based in Seattle where she can usually be found doodling in caf√©s, printing stickers in her studio, or trailing after neighborhood cats.

She creates colorful, graphic, and expressive illustrations that are cute with an unexpected twist. While much of her work has been personal, she's excited to grow into children's book illustration and is always open to playful, story-driven projects.
